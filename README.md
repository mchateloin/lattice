lattice
=======

A jQuery plugin that creates a 2-dimensional HTML grid slider from cell elements in a container.

#Demos

- [Main testing area](http://chateloin.com/dev/lattice/): This is what I'm using to work on the plugin. It'll be broken from time to time, sorry.

#Issues

Currently, it's a buggy work in progress. Performance is still being worked on. Features are still being implemented. Suggestions are highly welcome: mchateloin@gmail.com

#Upcoming Features

This is what I plan to implement before v1.0
- [ ] Ability to activate mouse, key, scroll, and swipe events for adjacent sliding.
