A jQuery plugin that's basically a 2-dimensional HTML slider.

I know what you're thinking. "Who cares, it's 2013, why are you building a slider?"

Well not only does this slider travel through a 2-dimensional grid, but it doesn't care what you slide. That's right, this isn't some cutesy image slider. Any block-level HTML elements will do. Just put them all in a containing element and you're ready to go. You know what else? You can slide to any part of the grid. Want to limit going backwards? Or left, right, up or down on any particular cell of the grid? Done! You can replace my stupid arrow links with your HTML. Don't like the pretty little grid map that it comes with, throw it out/customize it too! You can create your own links. 

Want to slide images? Ok whatever, fine, but this baby is built to slide page content. That's right, try putting your whole website in one page and just have visitors travel through it in a grid.

Currently, it's a buggy work in progress. Suggestions are highly welcome: mchateloin@gmail.com
