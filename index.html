                <ul>
                    <li>Navigate slides in two dimensions.</li>
                    <li>Generates a map of thumbnails representing each slide to navigate.</li>
                    <li>Specify thumbnail images for each slide. Thumbnails can be resized.</li>
                    <li>Restrict paths that can be followed.</li>
                    <li>The slider and the slides themselves are responsive</li>
                    <li>Use crop settings to crop to one of 9 areas of a slide as the slider decreases in width/height</li>
                    <li>Can dynamically generate thumbnails via a canvas screenshot of a slide. Thanks @niklasvh for the html2canvas project!</li>
