						<h2>One</h2>
						<p>The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="slide slide-green" data-order="1" data-row="1" data-col="2" data-travel="north,east">
					<div class="text-container">
						<h2>Two</h2>
						<p>The desert was the apotheosis of all deserts, huge, standing to the sky for what looked like eternity in all directions.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="slide slide-blue" data-order="2" data-row="1" data-col="3">
					<div class="text-container">
						<h2>Three</h2>
						<p>It was white and blinding and waterless and without feature save for the faint, cloudy haze of the mountains which sketched themselves on the horizon and the devil-grass which brought sweet dreams, nightmares, death.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="slide slide-red" data-order="3" data-row="1" data-col="4">
					<div class="text-container">
						<h2>Four</h2>
						<p>An occasional tombstone sign pointed the way, for once the drifted track that cut its way through the thick crust of alkali had been a highway. Coaches and buckas had followed it</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="slide slide-yellow" data-order="4" data-row="2" data-col="4">
					<div class="text-container">
						<h2>Five</h2>
						<p>The world had moved on since then. The world had emptied.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="slide slide-green" data-order="5" data-row="3" data-col="4">
					<div class="text-container">
						<h2>Six</h2>
						<p>There would be water if God willed it, the oldtimers said. Water if God willed it, even in the desert. The gunslinger stood up, brushing his hands.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="slide slide-purple" data-order="6" data-row="3" data-col="3">
					<div class="text-container">
						<h2>Seven</h2>
						<p>The gunslinger had been struck by a momentary dizziness, a kind of yawing sensation that made the entire world seem ephemeral, almost a thing that could be looked through.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="slide slide-orange" data-order="7" data-row="3" data-col="2">
					<div class="text-container">
						<h2>Eight</h2>
						<p>He laid the flint down the steel rod and struck his spark to the dry, shredded grass, muttering the old and powerful nonsense words as he did: "Spark-a-dark, where's my sire? Will I lay me? Will I stay me? Bless this camp with fire."</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="slide slide-blue" data-order="8" data-row="2" data-col="2">
					<div class="text-container">
						<h2>Nine</h2>
						<p>It passed and, like the world upon whose hide he walked, he moved on.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="slide slide-red" data-order="9" data-row="2" data-col="1">
					<div class="text-container">
						<h2>Ten</h2>
						<p>He passed the miles stolidly, not hurrying, not loafing. A hide waterbag was slung around his middle like a bloated sausage. It was almost full.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="slide slide-green" data-order="10" data-row="2" data-col="0">
					<div class="text-container">
						<h2>Eleven</h2>
						<p>He had progressed through the khef over many years, and had reached perhaps the fifth level.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="slide slide-purple" data-order="11" data-row="3" data-col="0">
					<div class="text-container">
						<h2>Twelve</h2>
						<p>His shirt, the no-color of rain or dust, was open at the throat, with a rawhide thong dangling loosely in hand-punched eyelets. His hat was gone.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="slide slide-orange" data-order="12" data-row="3" data-col="1">
					<div class="text-container">
						<h2>Thirteen</h2>
						<p>Had he been a Manni holy man, he might not have even been thirsty; he could have watched his own body dehydrate with clinical, detached attention, watering its crevices and dark inner hollows only when his logic told him it must be done.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="slide slide-yellow" data-order="13" data-row="4" data-col="1">
					<div class="text-container">
						<h2>Fourteen</h2>
						<p>He was not a Manni, however, nor a follower of the Man Jesus, and considered himself in no way holy.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="slide slide-red" data-order="14" data-row="4" data-col="2">
					<div class="text-container">
						<h2>Fifteen</h2>
						<p>He was just an ordinary pilgrim, in other words, and all he could say with real certainty was that he was thirsty. And even so, he had no particular urge to drink.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="slide slide-blue" data-order="15" data-row="5" data-col="2">
					<div class="text-container">
						<h2>Sixteen</h2>
						<p>In a vague way, all this pleased him. It was what the country required, it was a thirsty country, and he had in his long life been nothing if not adaptable.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="slide slide-orange" data-order="16" data-row="6" data-col="2">
					<div class="text-container">
						<h2>Seventeen</h2>
						<p>Below the waterbag were his guns, carefully weighted to his hands; a plate had been added to each when they had come to him from his father, who had been lighter and not so tall.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="slide slide-purple" data-row="1" data-col="0">
					<div class="text-container">
						<h2>Eighteen</h2>
						<p>The two belts crisscrossed above his crotch. The holsters were oiled too deeply for even this Philistine sun to crack.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="slide slide-green" data-row="0" data-col="4">
					<div class="text-container">
						<h2>Nineteen</h2>
						<p>The stocks of the guns were sandalwood, yellow and finely grained. Rawhide tiedowns held the holsters loosely to his thighs, and they swung a bit with his step; they had rubbed away the bluing of his jeans (and thinned the cloth) in a pair of arcs that looked almost like smiles.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="slide slide-yellow" data-row="4" data-col="4">
					<div class="text-container">
						<h2>Twenty</h2>
						<p>The brass casings of the cartridges looped into the gunbelts heliographed in the sun. There were fewer now. The leather made subtle creaking noises.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="slide slide-purple" data-row="5" data-col="0">
					<div class="text-container">
						<h2>Twenty One</h2>
						<p>His shirt, the no-color of rain or dust, was open at the throat, with a rawhide thong dangling loosely in hand-punched eyelets. His hat was gone. So was the horn he had once carried; gone for years, that horn, spilled from the hand of a dying friend, and he missed them both.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="slide slide-red" data-row="5" data-col="3">
					<div class="text-container">
						<h2>Twenty Two</h2>
						<p>He breasted a gently rising dune (although there was no sand here; the desert was hardpan, and even the harsh winds that blew when dark came raised only an aggravating harsh dust like scouring powder) and saw the kicked remains of a tiny campfire on the lee side, the side the sun would quit earliest.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="slide slide-blue" data-row="6" data-col="0">
					<div class="text-container">
						<h2>Twenty Three</h2>
						<p>Small signs like this, once more affirming the man in black's possible humanity, never failed to please him.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="slide slide-green" data-row="6" data-col="1">
					<div class="text-container">
						<h2>Twenty Four</h2>
						<p>His lips stretched in the pitted, flaked remains of his face. The grin was gruesome, painful. He squatted.</p>
